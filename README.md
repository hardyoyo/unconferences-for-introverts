## Introduction

I think every unconference I've attended has ended with the observation that not everyone has been as talkative as they could have been. This usually ends with the encouragement for everyone to speak up. I've come to expect it from unconferences, but I was still a bit surprised by it at a recent unconference I attended because I'd thought everyone _had_ spoken at one point during the two days. The conversation was not balanced by any means (there were participants who were much, much more vocal than others), but I'd thought everyone had participated at least once. I appreciated the follow up comment that acknowledged engagement wasn't necessarily the same thing as speaking up (that someone might be engaged, but not vocal). Still, there was the perfunctory encouragement to speak up and share with one's fellow participants.

For this particular unconference, I had to run off right after the wrap-up to make a teleconference I was scheduled to attend but, as I was walking away, I thought to myself: "You're just never going to get the kind of verbal engagement from introverts that you're going to get from extroverts." Basically, you're _always_ going to have a much quieter segment of unconference participants. I think, though, there are ways for unconferences to be more conducive to introverts (and I thought this unconference, in particular, had done a pretty good job of that).

What if I looked at unconferences from the perspective of an introvert (as if I could look at them from any other perspective). What could unconference organizers do to make the environment more welcoming and accessible to introverts? What could introverts do to better thrive in the unconference environment? Both of those might be combined into an _Unconferences for Introverts_ sort of (survival) guide.

I'd be interested in reading something like that because I'm an introvert and I admit that I find the expectations of unconferences overwhelming. It's not that I don't like the participatory nature of them. In fact, I love that. I like their democratic nature and their people-oriented approach but, being an introvert, they just plain exhaust me. I need recouperation time after interactions with other people and unconferences are nothing but interactions with other people. I also find the lightning pace of unconference discussions somewhat hard to follow because I'm constantly balancing the inner monologue of my introverted self with the exterior dialogue of the other unconference participants. Sometimes when I want to speak up, I've already lost the opportunity. By the time my inner monologue has processed the larger conversation, the conversation has shifted in a new direction.

So, what would a guide like this contain? I'd think some of the following things would be useful to include:

* Definitions / explanations of what an unconference is
* Definitions / explanations of what introverts are like
* A look at the friction points between unconferences and introverts
* How introverts feel at unconferences and how we deal with those feelings
* Things that unconference organizers could do to make unconferences more introvert-friendly (while still maintaining the lively atmosphere that extroverts like and expect)
* Approaches that introverts might adopt to better thrive at unconferences

Other things? I'm sure there are more.

So, where would I start with all this? I've informally thought about this every time I've considered attending an unconference (weighing the pros and cons of the format against my desire to attend), but I've never written anything about it or done any formal research on the topic.

I might start by looking to see if there has been any formal research done on the topic. I might also look around the Internet for people writing on this topic. I'd definitely be interested in hearing other introverts' perspectives (we're not all cut from the same cloth, though we share some common characteristics -- others might have different takes and/or approaches to the topic). It would be interesting to hear from unconference organizers too. I genuinely believe they want to make unconferences the best that they can be and I can tell that some have already given thought to this topic (in the decisions that they make while organizing the unconference).

So right now this is just an unorganized blob of stuff. I'm hoping this repo will give me a place to drop notes and write things on the topic. If anyone is interested in contributing thoughts and/or opinions, I'd definitely welcome them (PRs or Issues would be great). Is GitHub a user-friendly enough environment for that? I'd be willing to move this to GitBook or some other location that would be more user-friendly if need be (though perhaps GitHub's graphical editing interface is enough for those who aren't code monkeys?) I'm happy to add folks as collaborators on this repo if there is a desire.

I think at this point I'd be more interested in collecting perspectives than trying to winnow them down into something concise and focused (that could come later).

So, anyway... this is a kickoff for this repository. We'll see where it goes (if anywhere).
